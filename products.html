              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How long should I expect the laminates to last?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI laminates are coated with a UV and scratch resistant layer, resulting in a prolonged film lifetime. We offer a lifetime warranty on all of our security films, and guarantee that they will not peel, fade, or bubble over the lifetime of the glass, pending that they have been installed by one of our certified technicians.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Are ASI laminates noticeable once installed?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI works to provide the highest grade security laminates, while remaining optically clear. There may be a very slight decrease in optical clarity, as you increase the ballistic security level.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">What level of bullet resistance can your product provide?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Our engineering department can develop a solution to attain almost any level of bullet resistance, up to and including 7.62 x 51 NATO AP ammunition. All ASI laminates work in conjunction with the client’s existing glass substrate, therefore it should be noted that our laminates cannot stop a bullet without a minimum of ¼” thick glass substrate. Each project is evaluated by our ballistics and threat risk assessment team, on a case by case basis.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Can I install the laminates on my own?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes, clients can purchase our laminates without having them installed by our trained technicians. Although, it is highly recommended to have the film installed by an ASI tech, as there are many fine details that take a skilled hand to perfect. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How do I prepare the windows and area for an installation?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI technicians typically need approximately 3ft from the window that is being coated, to be free of furniture and other objects. Also, all window coverings, such as sun shades, and blinds should be removed from the working area. Due to the fact that our technicians must use a spray solution to apply the laminates, it is advised to remove any documents or devices from the work area that are not water resistant. The window being coated must be thoroughly cleaned, meaning all stickers, tint, decals, etc, must be removed prior to the installation. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Why is there a small gap between the film, and my window? </span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Our technicians must leave between 1/16” and 1/8” to allow for removal of the solution used to apply the laminates. Another reason our technicians will leave a slight gap along the edge, is because in extreme heat and cold situations, our laminates tend to expand and contract. If the laminates are touching the edge while in an expanding state, this could cause the laminates to lift off the glass, resulting in an air bubble.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How long does it take for ASI laminates to properly cure?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Once ASI laminates applied by a trained technician, they are generally at 70% strength once they have been set. The remaining 30% strength will be attained once our laminates have fully cured. Depending on the amount of sunlight the coated window is exposed to, this process may take 30-90 days. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">There are no ASI certified technicians in my area. Can this be accommodated? </span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI undertakes projects world wide. Once your scope of work has been assessed, we will then find a way to logistically conduct your project. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Which side of the window are the laminates applied on?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI security laminates can be applied to the interior or exterior side of the glass, but it must be applied to the side needing protection - which in most cases, is the interior side.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How should I clean my security laminates after they have been applied to my glass?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>You should not touch the film for a 30 day period. This 30 day period allows for the film to cure, and properly adhere to the glass it has been applied to. Once the 30 day curing period is completed, feel free to clean the coated windows using water, alcohol, or ammonia based mixtures. Be sure to use a soft cloth, paper towel, or squeegee. We recommend that you do not use any abrasive material on the security film, as this may result in decreased transparency.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Series 1 - SF-07</h2> </div>
            <p> Our Series 1 films are custom engineered to be applied to any existing glass, to create a protective barrier from broken, and falling glass. Glass fragments can cause serious injuries, but ASI films will convert this ordinary broken glass into a protective barrier.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although home security devices have improved quite a lot over the years, they still do not physically prevent an intruder from forcefully entering your property. Intruders can still enter your home after the alarm has been triggered. Coating your windows with ASI drastically increases the amount of time it takes for an intruder to break in, or can completely stop the act in its tracks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ASI films are almost impenetrable by most common smash and grab thieves. When under attack, our products continue to resist penetration. ASI laminates increase the glass’ break strength by 2-3 times, but if it does break, our film’s adhesive grip will hold most of the glass fragments together. The resistive force of ASI laminates discourages criminals from trying to break and enter, and also provides our secured clients with peace of mind.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All laminates sold by ASI are third-party tested by an internationally known laboratory, Intertek Testing Services (ITS). These test results concluded that ASI Series 1 SF-7 products are capable of withstanding 190 pounds of force per square inch. </p>
            <br>
            <p>ASI window films are recommended for houses, offices, hospitals, schools, and vehicles. </p>

              <h2>Series 2 - SL-09</h2> </div>
            <p>Every 18 seconds, a burglary takes place in the United States. In today’s day and age, it is not a good idea to leave your windows unprotected, or you may be the next victim of a break and enter. ASI’s Series 2 SL-09 product will protect you by transforming your windows from fragile entry points, into a strong protective barrier.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While advanced security systems are great, they are really only effective after the fact. Once the alarm sounds, they are most likely already inside of your facility, and gone within minutes, usually before law enforcement arrives on site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ASI’s Series 2 SL-09 product is often used by retailers, commercial property owners, and homeowners all over North America, and are engineered to resist smash and grabs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All windows and doors coated by ASI’s security laminates immediately become almost impenetrable, even under violent attacks. Once our product is fully cured, it forms a permanent bond with the glass, where our adhesives grip the glass fragments together, even once they have been broken. The combined force of our adhesives and laminates keeps the glass fragments together, to maintain structural integrity, and continue to resist the forced entry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ASI laminates have been third party tested against IED (improvised explosive devices), and are proven to be blast resistant, and superior in holding glass fragments together, minimizing injury from flying debris. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We highly recommend ASI’s Series 2 SL-09 products for storefronts, homes, hospitals, schools, vehicles, and many other facilities where safety and security is a priority.</p>

              <h2>Series 3 BR-14 - Ballistic Grade</h2> </div>
            <p>Although glass has become an integral part of modern day building design, due to its beautiful and cost effective style, it also must be noted that glass is the weakest entry point for most properties. ASI has engineered a solution to help glass resist modern day threats, including but not limited to bomb blasts, and small firearms.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The constant fluctuation in security threat levels poses a difficult challenge for building operators, and security professionals. Contributing to this challenging task is the fact that most buildings, such as schools, court houses, police stations and more, were built decades ago, when threat risks were not as prevalent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The benefit of ASI laminates is that they can be applied in-situ with any building, and not have any visual effect on the historical, architectural design. All building glass can remain the same, and simply just needs a layer of our BR-14 laminates to make those windows bullet resistant. </p>
            <br>
            <p>ASI Series 3 BR-14 laminates are custom engineered to be light-weight, optically clear, and cost effective, while achieving UL-Level 1 bullet-resistance. Starting with a minimum base of ¼’ annealed glass, coated with our BR-14 security film, we are capable of stopping rounds fired from small firearms, and IED (improvised explosive device) blasts. When ballistic applications are necessary, the installation must be completed by our certified ASI technicians to ensure the protection is up to spec.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Based on expected threat levels and the budget of our clients, ASI laminates can be custom configured to attain the highest level of burglar/bullet resistance required. Our Series 3 laminates are used on major corporations, store front businesses, broadcasters, military buildings, government buildings, embassies, schools, homes and more.</p>
