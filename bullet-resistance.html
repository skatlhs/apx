              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How long should I expect the laminates to last?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI laminates are coated with a UV and scratch resistant layer, resulting in a prolonged film lifetime. We offer a lifetime warranty on all of our security films, and guarantee that they will not peel, fade, or bubble over the lifetime of the glass, pending that they have been installed by one of our certified technicians.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Are ASI laminates noticeable once installed?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI works to provide the highest grade security laminates, while remaining optically clear. There may be a very slight decrease in optical clarity, as you increase the ballistic security level.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">What level of bullet resistance can your product provide?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Our engineering department can develop a solution to attain almost any level of bullet resistance, up to and including 7.62 x 51 NATO AP ammunition. All ASI laminates work in conjunction with the client’s existing glass substrate, therefore it should be noted that our laminates cannot stop a bullet without a minimum of ¼” thick glass substrate. Each project is evaluated by our ballistics and threat risk assessment team, on a case by case basis.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Can I install the laminates on my own?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes, clients can purchase our laminates without having them installed by our trained technicians. Although, it is highly recommended to have the film installed by an ASI tech, as there are many fine details that take a skilled hand to perfect. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How do I prepare the windows and area for an installation?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI technicians typically need approximately 3ft from the window that is being coated, to be free of furniture and other objects. Also, all window coverings, such as sun shades, and blinds should be removed from the working area. Due to the fact that our technicians must use a spray solution to apply the laminates, it is advised to remove any documents or devices from the work area that are not water resistant. The window being coated must be thoroughly cleaned, meaning all stickers, tint, decals, etc, must be removed prior to the installation. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Why is there a small gap between the film, and my window? </span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Our technicians must leave between 1/16” and 1/8” to allow for removal of the solution used to apply the laminates. Another reason our technicians will leave a slight gap along the edge, is because in extreme heat and cold situations, our laminates tend to expand and contract. If the laminates are touching the edge while in an expanding state, this could cause the laminates to lift off the glass, resulting in an air bubble.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How long does it take for ASI laminates to properly cure?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Once ASI laminates applied by a trained technician, they are generally at 70% strength once they have been set. The remaining 30% strength will be attained once our laminates have fully cured. Depending on the amount of sunlight the coated window is exposed to, this process may take 30-90 days. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">There are no ASI certified technicians in my area. Can this be accommodated? </span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI undertakes projects world wide. Once your scope of work has been assessed, we will then find a way to logistically conduct your project. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">Which side of the window are the laminates applied on?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>ASI security laminates can be applied to the interior or exterior side of the glass, but it must be applied to the side needing protection - which in most cases, is the interior side.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br> <span style="font-size:15pt;">How should I clean my security laminates after they have been applied to my glass?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>You should not touch the film for a 30 day period. This 30 day period allows for the film to cure, and properly adhere to the glass it has been applied to. Once the 30 day curing period is completed, feel free to clean the coated windows using water, alcohol, or ammonia based mixtures. Be sure to use a soft cloth, paper towel, or squeegee. We recommend that you do not use any abrasive material on the security film, as this may result in decreased transparency.</li>

            <h2>Bullet Resistance</h2> </div>
          <p>In today’s world, threat levels are evolving and changing each and every day. The constant change in threat levels across the world poses a difficult challenge for security specialists. What makes this even more challenging, is the fact that most buildings were built decades ago, in a time when security threats were not as pronounced. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Our light weight, clear, and cost effective ballistic laminates are designed to be retrofit to any building glass, and provide a quick solution to upgrade building glass security. Providing ballistic level security solutions to historical buildings presents significant technical, architectural, and financial challenges. Luckily, ASI laminates allow for a low cost, lightweight security glass solution that does not need any structural upgrades. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Apex Security Integrations work in-situ with your existing glass. For our product to achieve UL Level 1 bullet resistance to basic hand guns, our laminates must be applied to minimum ¼” thick annealed glass (6mm), which is the commercial standard for buildings in North America. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Depending on threat levels and budgets of our clients, our security laminates can be configured to provide resistance against burglary attempts, forced-entries, improvised explosive devices, bomb blasts, and small firearms.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Installations of ballistic grade security laminates must be conducted by a professionally trained ASI technician, to ensure it is up to our standards.</p>
          <br>
          <p>ASI’s in-house team includes experts in thread risk assessments, ballistic experts, and engineers. Our staff holds daily meetings about global threats, to ensure we remain up to date with ongoing risks. </p>
          <br>
          <p>ASI laminates are recommended for embassies, government and military buildings, broadcasters, storefront businesses, houses, vehicles, schools, hospitals, financial institutions, and more.</p>

              <h3>NO SUCH THING AS BULLETPROOF WINDOW FILM</h3>
              <p>There is no such thing as bullet-proofing. ASI does not pretend that its products are bullet, bomb or break-in “proof.” There is no such safety film or security laminate on the market. On its own, ASI laminates are inert. </p>
              <br>
              <p>However, once ASI laminates are applied to glass, the composite of the two materials work in tandem to resist, repel and absorb the kinetic forces involved with violent attacks. ASI products provide added protection against the effect of bullets, bombs and break-in entry attempts. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Independent third-party testing achieving a UL-752 rating has established that ASI's SL-14 product is capable of resisting bullets from such weapons as a .38 caliber, 9mm FMJ and .357, but at no time does ASI promote or lead clients to believe that bulletproofing or bomb proofing can be achieved solely with ASI products. ASI encourages potential clients to consider having an independent or third party risk threat assessment performed by one of our trained professionals or a competent independent security consultant to evaluate your security needs. </p>
              <br>
              <p>ASI does not encourage anyone to blindly shop for life saving materials either on-line or without verifying the vendors qualifications. Rather, ASI encourages every client to research and assess the ASI product or any product whereby protecting lives is a priority. Should you decide to proceed with ASI, then we will work with you to prepare a mock-up or as close as possible a sample of a typical window you need to protect and we will allow you to perform your own independent testing and evaluate the results for yourselves. Once that is completed, then in good conscience both you and ASI are confident that ASI can meet your needs.</p>
